## News & History

Our app allows users -- students, scholars, journalists, citizens -- to explore history through news articles. 
Using an archive of [Guardian articles](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/explore/) from 1851 to 2016 , 
the app allows users to contrast and compare how the media has covered different topics over time. 
When a user chooses an article from the daily news, the app returns related articles from the past based on metadata 
such as keywords (such as named entities, “Clinton,” or “election”) 
and categories (broader topic words such as “science,” or “politics”). 
For example: an article today about a presidential candidate talking about women’s rights issues could display 
an article from the 1960s regarding a presidential candidate on women’s rights issues. 
Additionally, the app would allow users associated with education to add articles to a watchlist 
so they can read a them at a later time and study comparisons and contrasts in more detail. 
In this way, educational user entities not only directly interact with news article entities, 
but with their watchlist and with metadata (date, keywords, categories).
Thus, the app allows readers to explore new news with old news for a new perspective. 
We will be starting will a smaller subset of articles based around presidential elections, which will allow us to easily divide these articles into categories and draw relationships between new and old articles.
